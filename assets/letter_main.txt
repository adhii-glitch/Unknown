Hey Amul,

From the very first day we spoke, you weren’t just someone I liked…
You became my best friend,
my secret keeper,
my constant support,
and the smile I never knew I was missing.

You call me “Adhiiiii” — stretching my name with love,
and every time you say it,
I feel like I belong.
Not just to the moment, but to you.

In this friendship, I found laughter, comfort, and trust.
In this love, I’ve found something even deeper —
a connection that words can barely describe.

I don’t want to lose either.
Not the friendship,
not the love,
not you.

So today, I want to ask you something with all my heart:
Will you be mine — not just as my best friend, but as my forever?

Let’s turn this friendship into the most beautiful story.
Let’s build something that lasts —
with laughter, with love, with us.

Just Amul and Adhiiiii, forever…
